</p>

<h6>Complete satisfaction promise</h6>
<p>
RebeccaandPenelope.com Limited ('Rebecca & Penelope ') guarantees your total satisfaction with our products and services. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your online purchase, simply call us within 21 days and return the goods to us.
</p>
<h6>Contract for sale</h6>
<p>The advertising of products on this site is an 'invitation to treat'. That means your order is an offer, not a contract of sale between you and Rebecca & Penelope, so prices and stock availability won't be contractually confirmed until you receive the 'confirmation of order' email dispatched once credit card authorisation has been confirmed and stock levels have been checked.
</p>
<p>These terms and conditions cannot be varied except by changes made by Rebecca & Penelope on the site, which we may make from time to time. In particular, nothing said by any representative of Rebecca & Penelope will operate as a variation to these terms and conditions or constitutes a legal representation on behalf of them.
</p>
<h6>Receipt of order</h6>
<p>Rebecca & Penelope must receive payment in full for your order before it can be accepted. Once your credit card has been authorized and stock is checked, Rebecca & Penelope will send you an email receipt confirming your order. Please keep this receipt for your records.
</p>
<p>We can only accept orders for items that are in stock. In exceptional circumstances, if we are not able to fulfill an order we have accepted, your credit card will be re-credited with the original price and we will notify you by email. In no circumstances will we be liable to you for any additional amounts.
</p>
<p>Rebecca & Penelope reserve the right to refuse to supply to any person for whatever reason.
</p>
<h6>Returning a product</h6>
<p>If you need to return an item purchased online, contact us at customercare@RebeccaandPenelope.co.uk or call us on 0845 120 2923. You will need to have your original credit card details handy for this call and we will need to talk to the person who bought the item (so if you e-mail us then please leave a phone number).
</p>
<p>The personal shopping consultant will give you a return authorisation number, which you need to include with the items being returned along with the name of the person that placed the initial order, their telephone number and the original order number. Please return (in the original packaging if possible) to Rebecca & Penelope. A prompt refund will be issued if the item is in its original condition and all the information referred to above is received. The credit card used for the original purchase will be credited with the original price. If there are any problems with your refund, a personal shopping consultant will contact you.
</p>
<h6>Cancellations and exchanges</h6>
<p>If you realized you made a mistake and want to cancel your order, please contact us. Since we ship quickly, it may not be possible to stop your order so please follow the instructions for 'Returning a Product' in those instances. Exchanges work in the same way. It will be faster to re-order a product rather than send it back for an exchange, so please follow the above instructions while you order the product you would like instead. We realize this means two transactions on your credit card but feel it is faster for you to get the product you would like.
</p>
<h6>Defective and damaged items</h6>
<p>If you should receive an item that is defective, damaged or not what you ordered, please contact us within 10 days. Our personal shopping consultants will help you resolve any issues as quickly as possible by delivering another item, replacing your order or refunding the amount paid.
</p>
<h6>Customer care and call centre hours</h6>
<p>If you need assistance for any reason, please contact us at customercare@RebeccaandPenelope.co.uk.
</p>
Representatives are available 8.30am to 5.00pm (GMT) Monday to Friday.
</p>
<h6>Safety and Security</h6>
<p>We accept VISA and MasterCard.
</p>
<p>To securely receive your payments over the Internet we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which is the standard Internet practice and means your details are protected. You can see that you are in a secure environment through the 'padlock' symbol on Microsoft Internet Explorer or 'key' symbol on Netscape Navigator. SSL works with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 and later/ Netscape Browser versions 2.0 and later. We feel it's important to have this level of security available, so anyone using lower version browsers should contact us by phone to place an order.
</p>
<p>Please don't try to send orders via email, as we cannot guarantee any secure transmission of details. If you're still worried about security over the Internet, then please contact us by phone.
</p>
